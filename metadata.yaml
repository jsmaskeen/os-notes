  These notes were compiled during the Aug-Nov 2025 offering of the CS330: Operating Systems course, based on *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)*.

  \noindent The aim is to present Virtualization, Concurrency, and Persistence in a clear, and consise manner, making it suitable for quick revision before exams. Or to be used as a cheatsheet, if the professor allows (Hello Abhishek Sir :D)
  In case of any additions or errors (typos or formatting), please feel free to reach out to me at \texttt{jaskirat.maskeen@iitgn.ac.in}. Also, special thanks to Abhinav Khot, for helping me proofread these notes.
